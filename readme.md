# Neurodynamics Final Project
Implementation as well as evaluation and discussion of the multi-timescale adaptive threshold (MAT) neuron model.

## Coding Session 1: 01. July 2020
- implemented base structure
- struggled to generate adequate membrane potential
- no available input data for testing

## Coding Session 2: 07. July 2020
- implemented function to generate input current
- voltage calculation still problematic
